## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from `National University of Science and Technology "MISIS"` with a degree in materials science and technology. To be more precise, it is an interdisciplinary science, with an emphasis on physics.
While I was doing my diploma, I was interested in simulating the growth of nanocoatings at the atomic level, as a result of which I wrote my first program. From that moment on, I began to devote more and more of my time to modeling, and then to programming. So I realized that I like the second one much more. And since then, I completely changed my main profession to a web developer.
